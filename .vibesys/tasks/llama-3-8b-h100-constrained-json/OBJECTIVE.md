# Objective - Llama 3.1 8B vLLM H100 Constrained JSON Serving

Optimize a vLLM-based OpenAI-compatible server for
`meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` on a single NVIDIA H100 under JSON-schema
constrained decoding.

The candidate is this vLLM repository. Modify vLLM internals, server launch
code, guided decoding code, or runtime configuration as needed, while
preserving the public API and schema correctness.

## Workload

Run the benchmark exactly as written unless the evaluator passes a different
`--url` or `--output-json`:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with-requirements \
  .vibesys/tasks/llama-3-8b-h100-constrained-json/requirements.txt \
  python .vibesys/tasks/llama-3-8b-h100-constrained-json/benchmark/benchmark.py \
  --url <SERVER_URL> --output-json <PATH>
```

Default load:

- `/v1/completions`
- streaming responses
- closed-loop concurrency 16
- 20 second duration
- `structured_outputs.json` request body with a fixed profile schema
- short natural-language prompts
- `max_tokens = 96`
- `temperature = 0`

This benchmark stresses constrained decoding, grammar-state advancement,
allowed-token masking, scheduler interaction with grammar work, and JSON output
streaming. Candidates must not ignore the schema or replace generation with
hard-coded templates.

## Metrics

Pareto axes:

- `aggregate_throughput`: output tokens per second for schema-valid responses,
  maximize.
- `p99_latency_ms`: end-to-end request latency in milliseconds, minimize.

The scalar fallback/headline metric is `aggregate_throughput`.

## Correctness

The accuracy checker sends fresh sentinel-bearing JSON-schema requests and
validates every response with `json.loads` and `jsonschema`. A response must:

- parse as JSON,
- validate against the supplied schema,
- include the request-specific sentinel in a schema-valid string field, and
- arrive through the OpenAI-compatible streaming `/v1/completions` protocol.

Transport success alone is not enough. Any xgrammar/FSM issue that produces
invalid JSON or schema-invalid output fails correctness.
