# Constrained JSON Accuracy Checker

The checker sends streaming `/v1/completions` requests with
`structured_outputs.json` and validates each returned text with `json.loads`
and `jsonschema`. Each case contains a fresh sentinel value that must appear in
the schema-valid `sentinel` field, which prevents hard-coded schema-only
outputs.
