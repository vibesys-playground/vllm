# Objective - Llama-3.3 70B vLLM 2xH100 Serving

Optimize a vLLM-based OpenAI-compatible server for
`meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` on 2x NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs.

The candidate is this vLLM repository. Modify vLLM internals, server launch
code, or runtime configuration as needed, while preserving the public API and
correctness gates.

The model (~140 GB bf16) does not fit in one GPU. The implementation must serve
it across both GPUs (tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, or any other
strategy).

## Workload

Run the benchmark exactly as written unless the evaluator passes a different
`--url` or `--output-json`:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with-requirements \
  .vibesys/tasks/llama-70b-2xh100-vllm/requirements.txt \
  python .vibesys/tasks/llama-70b-2xh100-vllm/benchmark/benchmark.py \
  --url <SERVER_URL> --output-json <PATH>
```

Default load:

- `/v1/completions`
- streaming responses
- closed-loop concurrency 8
- 30 second duration
- medium-length synthetic prompts (~256 words)
- `max_tokens = 128`
- `temperature = 0`

This benchmark stresses multi-GPU communication, weight sharding, KV-cache
management across devices, scheduler overhead, and decode throughput. Candidates
must not reduce prompt length, duration, concurrency, or max output tokens to
improve the score.

## Metrics

Pareto axes:

- `aggregate_throughput`: output tokens per second, maximize.
- `p99_latency_ms`: end-to-end request latency in milliseconds, minimize.

The scalar fallback/headline metric is `aggregate_throughput`.

## Correctness

The accuracy checker drives the running server over HTTP with three
reference-free gates: sentinel echo, known-answer, and greedy determinism. It
requires a real prompt-conditioned Llama forward pass. Canned responses, prompt
echoing, skipped model execution, or non-deterministic temperature-0 decoding
fail the task.
