Accuracy checker for Llama-3.3-70B (service-style).

The checker drives a **running** OpenAI-compatible server over HTTP. It does
not import the candidate's model or load weights locally, so it works the same
against a local, Docker, or remote Modal server. Point it at the server URL:

    uv run --no-project --with-requirements \
      .vibesys/tasks/llama-70b-2xh100-vllm/requirements.txt \
      python .vibesys/tasks/llama-70b-2xh100-vllm/accuracy_checker/checker.py \
      --url http://localhost:8000

Correctness is established with three reference-free gates (see `--help` for
thresholds):

1. **Sentinel-echo** -- each request embeds a random token the prompt tells the
   model to reproduce; canned/templated servers can't reproduce a fresh token.
2. **Known-answer** -- near-deterministic factual prompts at temperature 0
   (capital of France -> Paris, 1+1 -> 2, ...); a prompt echoer fails these.
3. **Greedy determinism** -- the same prompt twice at temperature 0 must match.

Exit code 0 iff there are no transport errors and all three gates clear their
thresholds. Use `--output-json <path>` to dump per-request detail.
