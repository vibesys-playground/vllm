# TraceLab replay benchmark

`benchmark.py` invokes the task-owned TraceLab replay implementation in
`benchmark/tracelab-replay`. It downloads the pinned TraceLab public DuckDB
release, verifies its SHA256, converts it with TraceLab's CSV exporter, and
directly invokes TraceLab's Rust `session_runner`.

Run:

```bash
uv run python .vibesys/tasks/qwen3-coder-tracelab-h100/benchmark/benchmark.py \
  --url http://localhost:8000 \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-FP8 \
  --output-json /tmp/tracelab_replay.json
```

The primary metric is `aggregate_output_tokens_per_second`.

By default the benchmark runs 16 real TraceLab sessions with up to 8 active
sessions at once. This keeps scoring trace-shaped while giving vLLM enough
independent chats to exercise continuous batching during tool waits and long
prefills. Lower `--max-sessions` / `--max-active-sessions` manually for quick
smoke tests.
