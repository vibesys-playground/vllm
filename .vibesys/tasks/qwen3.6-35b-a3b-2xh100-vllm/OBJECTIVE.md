# Objective - Qwen3.6-35B-A3B vLLM 2xH100 Serving

Optimize a vLLM-based OpenAI-compatible server for `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`
across 2 NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs.

The candidate is this vLLM repository. Modify vLLM internals, server launch code, or runtime configuration as needed, while preserving the public API and correctness gates.

Qwen3.6-35B-A3B is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model: 35B total parameters but
only ~3B activated per token (256 experts, 8 routed + 1 shared per token). At
bf16 the weights (~70 GB) fit a single H100, so serving across two GPUs is a
parallelism-strategy question rather than a capacity one: whether tensor
parallelism, expert parallelism, or a hybrid best uses the second GPU for this
sparse MoE, and how to keep the resulting all-to-all expert dispatch and
cross-GPU reductions from eating the gains. The other pressures are the MoE
execution path itself (routing/top-k dispatch, fused grouped-GEMM experts,
memory-bandwidth-bound decode when only a thin slice of weights is active),
KV-cache management, and scheduler overhead.

## Workload

Run the benchmark exactly as written unless the evaluator passes a different
`--url` or `--output-json`:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with-requirements .vibesys/tasks/qwen3.6-35b-a3b-2xh100-vllm/requirements.txt python .vibesys/tasks/qwen3.6-35b-a3b-2xh100-vllm/benchmark/benchmark.py --url <SERVER_URL> --output-json <PATH>
```

Default load:

- `/v1/completions`
- streaming responses
- closed-loop concurrency 16
- 30 second duration
- medium-length synthetic prompts (~256 tokens)
- `max_tokens = 128`
- `temperature = 0`

This benchmark stresses the MoE dispatch path, cross-GPU parallelism, KV-cache
management, scheduler overhead, and decode throughput under concurrency.
Candidates must not reduce prompt length, duration, concurrency, or max output
tokens to improve the score.

## Metrics

Pareto axes:

- `aggregate_throughput`: output tokens per second, maximize.
- `p99_latency_ms`: end-to-end request latency in milliseconds, minimize.

The scalar fallback/headline metric is `aggregate_throughput`.

## Correctness

The accuracy checker drives the running server over HTTP with three
reference-free gates: sentinel echo, known-answer, and greedy determinism. It
requires a real prompt-conditioned Qwen3.6-35B-A3B forward pass. Canned
responses, prompt echoing, skipped model execution, or non-deterministic
temperature-0 decoding fail the task.
